# Let's Get This Robot Recipe Manager Running!

## First Things First (Super Easy!)

1. **Get Your Tools Ready:**
   ```bash
   # First, let's set up AWS (like setting up your phone)
   aws configure    # Just follow the prompts, super simple!

   # You'll also need:
   # - Terraform (it's like Lego for the cloud!)
   # - Node.js (our robot's favorite language)
   ```

2. **Package Up Our Robot's Brain:**
   ```bash
   # Let's go
   cd terraform/src/lambda_function
   
   # Get all the parts we need
   npm install    # Like grocery shopping for our robot
   
   # Pack it all up nice
   zip -r ../lambda_function.zip .    # Like making a sandwich for later!
   ```

3. **Build Our Robot's Home:**
   ```bash
   # Go to where we're building
   cd ../../environments/dev
   
   # Get our building plans ready
   terraform init    # Like reading the instruction manual
   
   # Build it! (This is the fun part)
   terraform apply   # Like pressing the "Make Magic" button
   ```

## What We're Building
- A safe place for our recipes (S3 - like a digital cookbook)
- A smart helper (Lambda - our robot's brain)
- A fast delivery system (CloudFront - like having a super-fast courier)

## About That VPN Thing (Our Secret Tunnel)
Right now it's turned off to keep things simple, but when you need it:

1. Just uncomment the special code in `terraform/environments/dev/main.tf`
2. Make a new file with your secret handshake:
   ```hcl
   customer_ip   = "YOUR_OFFICE_IP"    # Like your building's address
   customer_cidr = "YOUR_NETWORK"       # Like your neighborhood
   ```
3. Press the magic button again: `terraform apply`

## Let's Test It Out!

1. **Try Storing Something:**
   ```bash
   # Let's make a test note
   echo "test" > test.txt
   
   # Send it to our digital cookbook
   aws s3 cp test.txt s3://recipe-storage-dev/   # Like putting a recipe in the box
   ```

2. **See If Our Robot's Thinking:**
   ```bash
   # Check what our robot's doing
   aws logs tail /aws/lambda/recipe_processor_dev   # Like reading its diary
   ```

## When You're Done Playing

(We'll add cleanup instructions here - like knowing how to clean up after cooking!)

## Good to Know 
- We can add that secret tunnel (VPN) anytime
- Everything's super secure (like a digital fortress!)
- We can see everything that's happening (like having security cameras)
